# Ruby on Replit

This is a template to get you started with Ruby on Replit. It's ready to go so you can just hit run and start coding!

## Running the repl

Simply hit run! You can edit the run command from the `.replit` file.

## Installing packages

To add packages to your repl, we recommend using the Replit packager interface in the left sidebar or using `bundle install` in the shell. Check out the [Bundle docs here](https://bundler.io/guides/getting_started.html).

**Warning: Avoid using `gem install` to add packages.**

Beacuse Ruby repls use [Bundle](https://bundler.io/) under the hood to provide a consistent environment that tracks and installs the exact gems and versions needed, we recommend using `bundle install` instead of `gem install`, which may not work as expected.

## Help

If you need help you might be able to find an answer on our [docs](https://docs.replit.com) page. Feel free to report bugs and give us feedback [here](https://replit.com/support).

Practice problem
Create a Ruby program that performs the following tasks using encapsulation and access modifiers that includes public and private methods:

Define a class called 'Animal' that takes a name as an argument.
Define a public method called print_details that prints the name of the animal.
Define a private method called print_details_private that prints the name of the animal.
Create an instance of the Animal class called 'animal'.
Call the 'print_details' method on the 'animal' instance.
Call the 'print_details_private' method on the 'animal' instance.
Define a class called 'Dog' that inherits from the 'Animal' class.
Create an instance of the 'Dog' class called 'dog'.
Call the 'print_details' method on the 'dog' instance.
Call the 'print_details_private' method on the 'dog' instance.
